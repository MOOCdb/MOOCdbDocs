===================


Data from edX platform is primarily stored in JSON logs. A fundamental axis which is used to record precisely the activity performed 
by the learner is an "event type". Multiple "event types" differentiate between different activities done by the learner. We base
our software on this fundamental axis. Below we provide detailed description of how each event type is translated into an entry in 
MOOCdb. This detailed information gives researchers and plaform providers information about MOOCdb translation and how data is mapped 
syntactically and semantically.
