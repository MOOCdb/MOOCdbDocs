Collaborative platforms
############

This documentation is for folks to install different open source platforms that MOOCdb project has. They include 
Collaborative visualization platform - MOOCviz, platform to crowd source feature and variable formation - Feature Factory,
platform for getting labels from the crowd - LabelMe-Text. These instructions allow folks to create their own instantiation of the 
platform for internal use. The instructions will enable to download the software and deploy a server for each one of these platforms. 


MOOCviz
=======


Data from edX platform is primarily stored in JSON logs. A fundamental axis which is used to record precisely the activity performed 
by the learner is an "event type". Multiple "event types" differentiate between different activities done by the learner. We base
our software on this fundamental axis. Below we provide detailed description of how each event type is translated into an entry in 
MOOCdb. This detailed information gives researchers and plaform providers information about MOOCdb translation and how data is mapped 
syntactically and semantically.
